SYNOPSIS
       boom [-VTOAP] [-l num] [-d num] [-i num] [-a num] [-sjbgpwtmorn]
                      filename [outname]

DESCRIPTION
       BOOM is used for the first step of the synthesis process.  It optimizes a behavioural
       description  using  a Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram representation of logic
       functions.  The file filename is the input behavioural description and must be  writ‐
       ten  in vbe(5) format.  The resulting behavioural optimized description is saved with
       the name outname or input_name_o in vbe(5) format.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       MBK_WORK_LIB(1)
                 indicates the path to the read/write directory for the session.


OPTIONS
       -V        Verbose mode on.  Each step of the optimization is displayed on  the  stan‐
                 dard output.

       -T        Trace  mode on.  Some debug informations are displayed on the standard out‐
                 put.

       -O        Reverses initial Bdd variables order.

       -A        BOOM performs a local optimization and keeps the architecture of  the  ini‐
                 tial  description by saving most of the intermediate signals.  This mode is
                 well-suited for big or regular circuits such as  multipliers,  adders.   By
                 default  BOOM performs a global optimization and removes most of the inter‐
                 mediate signals so that the outputs are expressed in terms of the inputs or
                 the  internal registers.  This mode is well-suited for random circuits such
                 as FSMs.

       -P        Uses a parameter file input_name.boom  describing  optimization  directives
                 and constraints.  (see below for the exact syntax)

                 # Example of .boom file

                 #
                 # The list of auxiliary signals that have to be kept
                 # during optimization.
                 # Generally carry signals, ram address signals etc ...
                 #
                 BEGIN_KEEP

                 carry[3:0]
                 ram_address[3:0]

                 END

                 #
                 # The list of auxiliary signals which assigned
                 # expression won't be modified.
                 # Generally it's ram output signals.
                 #
                 BEGIN_DONT_TOUCH
                 ram_out[7:0]
                 END


       -l num    Specifies the optimization level [0-3] (default is 0, low level).

       -d num    Specifies  the  delay  optimization percent (default is 0% delay, 100% sur‐
                 face).

       -i num    Specifies the number of iterations for the choosen  optimization  algorithm
                 (for experts only).

       -a num    Specifies the amplitude during bdd reordering (for experts only).

       -sjbgpwtmorn
                 Specifies which algorithm has to be used for the boolean optimization.
