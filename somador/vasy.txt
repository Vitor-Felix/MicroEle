NAME
       VASY - VHDL Analyzer for Synthesis


ORIGIN
       This  software belongs to the  ALLIANCE CAD SYSTEM developed by the ASIM team at LIP6 laboratory of Universit√© Pierre et Marie CURIE, in Paris,
       France.

SYNOPSIS
       vasy [-VpavsoipSHL] [-C num] [-E num] [-I format] [-P file] filename [outname]

DESCRIPTION
       VASY is a hierarchical VHDL Analyzer for Synthesis.  VASY performs a semantic analysis of a VHDL RTL description filename, with a  VHDL  subset
       much more extended than the Alliance one (see vasy(5) for more details), and identifies with precision all the memorizing elements and tristate
       buffers.
       During its analysis, VASY expands generic parameters, executes generic map and generate statements, and also unrolls static FOR loops.
       At the end, VASY drives an equivalent description outname (in Verilog or VHDL format) accepted by most of synthesis tools.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       MBK_WORK_LIB(1)
                 indicates the path to the read/write directory for the session.


OPTIONS
       -V        Verbose mode on.  Each step of the analysis is displayed on the standard output.

       -v        Drives an equivalent description in Verilog format.

       -a        Drives an equivalent description in Alliance VHDL format vbe(5) and/or vst(5).  We can note that with  this  option,  all  arithmetic
                 operators are expanded in an equivalent set of boolean expressions, because these operators don't belong to the Alliance VHDL subset.

       -s        Drives an equivalent VHDL description (with the extention .vhd) accepted by most of industrial synthesis tools.

       -S        Uses Std_logic instead of Bit (taken into account only with option -s).

       -i        Drives initial signal values (taken into account only with option -s).

       -I format Specifies the VHDL input format such as Alliance VHDL format vbe(5), vst(5) or industrial VHDL format vhd or vhdl.

       -H        In  a  structural  description,  all model of instances are recursively analyzed.  (By default VASY analyzes only models with generic
                 parameters) The leaves cells are defined by a file called CATAL (see catal(5) for details).

       -o        Authorizes to overwrite existing files.

       -p        Adds power supply connectors (vdd and vss). Usefull option to enter in Alliance.

       -C num    When the size of the adder is greater or equal to num a Carry Look Ahead adder is generated, instead of a Ripple Carry adder.  (taken
                 into account only with option -a).

       -E num    Comparators  are  expanded  in an equivalent set of boolean expressions, when their size is greater than num (taken into account only
                 with option -a).

       -L        A file .lax (see lax(5) for details) is generated. This file contains the list of all signals that must be kept during the  synthesis
                 step, using boom (see boom(1) for details). (taken into account only with option -a).

       -P file   Specifies a 'file.pkg' containing a list of logical and physical package name:
                 # Example
                 work.constants.all  : pkg_constants
                 work.components.all : pkg_components
